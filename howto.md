# HowTo.ppt

It happens way too often to me: I watch a conference talk that has an *amazing* premise, well-researched background information and the most interesting field in the world ... and it bombs. Horribly. People are bored, the presentation drags on and on and on, and I wonder, where has all the energy gone?

Turns out, **even good ideas need awesome presentation.**

Too often, the really good ideas are presented badly. Why? I think because the people who think about the really good ideas don't assign themselves a lot of brain space to think much about presentation, or because they are of the opinion that the idea is *so* incredibly good, it should stand on its own. While that may be correct, it is also arrogant. You *want* to get your idea out there, don't you? You *want* people to think about it and talk about and maybe even try and find flaws in your idea, so you can improve on it and have even better ideas. The more easily digestible you make your idea by virtue of presenting it **not badly**, the more people will listen to you. Don't dilute your message, just avoid the most basic mistakes. 

I'm not an expert on public speaking. I've held a few moderately successful talks at uni and I'm generally okay at small talk and traversing larger groups. But I've been thinking about the subject of better public speaking a lot, and I've assembled a few tips for my fellow hackers and enthusiasts. There are a lot of resources online, in books, and as courses about this, and you should totally consume all of those. I've linked to the ones I think are most relevant below. But in the meantime, how about I try to distill some kind of tl;dr out of the available material? In addition to the elements of presentations that programmers will need more often than others (source code, demos, video), I'll focus on those things that, in my opinion, hackers and hacker-like people most often get wrong.

This article is kinda mix-and-match. Read through it, and pick out those tips that most appeal to you, and try to apply them to your talk. Before we start, though, I have to address one elephant in the room:

## On the Fruit Company

So I use an Apple computer and I sometimes write software that runs on their platforms. I also like fonts, and colors, and weird color spaces. Hackers and hacker-like people distrust people like me, because they think it's all presentation and no message. Well, forget about that. Use any font you like. Use any color you like. Create your presentation on BSD, OSX, Windows or any Linux you like, because that doesn't matter one bit. I like slides in a specific set of colors, and with a specific set of fonts, but that's just my style, and it shouldn't necessarily be yours. 

Colors, fonts, OSes... they're all window dressing, and don't really affect your core idea. What should really be important is more general: How do you present your idea so people can *grok* it? So let's start with some structure.

## How to Structure Your Talk

Obviously your talk needs structure. You need to explain things one by one before you can use them in larger building blocks -- resolve your dependencies. 

In addition to that, here are a few more tips to improve the structuring of your talk. 

- don't tell people your structure beforehand
- have one take-away from your talk
- have a connection between opening and closing 
- repeat your message
- timing

## You Don't Need Slides

Slides are definitely not the most important thing about your talk, but they comprise the area where hackers and hacker-like people make the most mistakes. Maybe because we all stare at screens so much? In any case...

**You should be able to hold your talk without any slides.**

Yes, you have diagrams and screenshots and cat pictures and *oooodles* of data, but the art you are performing is *public speaking*. People are there to listen to you, to be in the same room with you, everything else is secondary. You are on stage as an ambassador to your idea, and not just as the person who clicks the "Next"-button on the remote.

If the projector fails, or your computer shreds all the slides of your presentation, you should still be able to confidently walk on stage and tell the world about your idea. Think about it as one less thing that can go wrong.

What about those who missed my talk, you ask? They will be unable to download your slides and understand my idea! That is correct. However, they can just get the audio from your talk and have a killer podcast to listen to on their way to work. Or you could even go the extra mile an create a transcript afterwards, but that's pretty optional.

## What Slides are for

Slides are there to **enhance** your talk, not **be** your talk. So, what should you put on your slides? Let's start with what *not* to put on slides:

**Never put the things you want to say on a slide.**

Imagine a novice speaker with a great idea. Their slide reads: "Methods to improve Cat Photo detection: 1. Fur Detection Algorithm. 2. Matching Intermittent Aural Output Widgets. 3. Employ Humans."

To this, they say the following words: "We have various methods to improve at Photo detection. First, we have a fur detection algorithm. Next, we implement Matching Intermittent Aural Output Widgets. Third, we can use humans to improve our output."

Humans get bored very easily when they receive the same information on different channels, and tune out of the channel that seems slower to them. Notice how you almost certainly skipped parts of the previous paragraph? It's even worse in an actual talk. 

Instead, **your slides should complement your talk**.

An improvement over this example would be to split the slide into three slides, each showing relevant *background* information about the detection method: An example of the fur detection in action. The words "or MIAOW for short." Some cat photos that are detectable by those methods. Or you could simple display "Cat Detection Methods" as the headline to that part of your talk.

Have a look at this video of Stephen Colbert's *The Word* on Ayn Rand (it's 6 minutes of presentation awesome):

Heres a [Link, in case the embed does not work](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/221335/march-11-2009/the-word---rand-illusion).

* Most of the time when Colbert is speaking, there is just background behind him. No slides, you just focus on the speaker.
* Videos are full-screen (with a banner citing the date of publication, doubling as a source here), but the talk would work without it. They back up Colbert's claims, and are well-selected.
* Points are made by Colbert, and the slides emphasize them, serve as examples or as proof, allowing him to stay on his message. (In this example, they also contradict him for comedic effect. You should probably not do that.)
* If Colbert talks about something, like Rand's book, sales numbers, or specific quotes, the slides show that.

So, in summary: 

1. Your slides are way less important than your talk.
2. They should complement your talk, not structure it.
3. Never ever put the things you want to say on a slide.
4. Really. Never do that.

## Source Code Slides

You should probably not put source code on your slides. People will not be able to read it from the back, and even those who *can* read it won't have time to completely *get* it, because you're talking, remember? 

In ninety nine percent of all cases, it's better to include a link to the repository in your sources than to show actual code. But, sometimes you need to highlight a language feature, or show a very specific part of a program, so here are my rules for showing code:

1. As little as possible. Only show 3-5 lines at most. Can you make anything simpler? Do it!
2. As large as possible. The font size for this should be *huge*, so even the people in the back who can only see half of your slide can get a glimpse at it.
3. Monospaced and syntax-highlighted. Do everything you can to improve legibility.
